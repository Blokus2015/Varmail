Welcome to varmail!

Varmail allows you to send variable email  messages to your friends, customers, or team. 

Simply create an account or sign in, head to the homepage, create some organizations, and then create your messages for each organization. 

Once you create messages, you can send emails. Just select the send emails button, fill out the information in the text boxes, and select a prebuild message. Click send message when you're ready. 

And, just like that, you're on your way to becoming a varmail pro! 

This app is deployed here: https://varmail.web.app/
